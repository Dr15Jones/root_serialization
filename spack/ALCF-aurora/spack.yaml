# This is a Spack Environment file.
#
# It describes a set of packages to be installed, along with
# configuration settings.
#
# I'm keeping this one deliberately high level: you can tell your own spack
# installation about external packages and preferred MPI implementations
# usage:
#    spack env activate .
#    spack install
